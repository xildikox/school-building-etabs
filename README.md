# 🏫 School Building Design and Analysis – CE 482 Final Project

This project presents the structural modeling and analysis of a reinforced concrete school building using **ETABS**. The building is designed in accordance with:

- 🇹🇷 Turkish Earthquake Code (latest version)
- TS500 (Reinforced Concrete Design Code)

## 📌 Project Tasks

1. **Modal Analysis** using ETABS
2. **Beam and Column Design** based on modal frequencies
3. **Modal Time History Analysis**
4. **Response Spectrum Analysis**

Only the self-weight of the structure was considered in loading conditions. Member dimensions vary per student; my version includes a column length of `z - 0.4`.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- ETABS (for structural modeling and analysis)
- Microsoft Word (for report preparation)

## 📂 Files Included

- `.EDB` file: ETABS model  
- `Report.pdf` or `.docx`: Design and analysis report  
- `Screenshot.png`: View of ETABS model  

## 📌 Notes

This project was completed as part of the **CE 482 Structural Design** course. All assumptions not provided in the project description were made based on engineering judgment.
